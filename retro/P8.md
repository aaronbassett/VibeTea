# Phase 8 Retrospective: User Story 6 - Connection Status with Flair

**Feature**: Client Frontend Redesign
**Phase**: 8 - Enhanced connection indicator with animated ring effects, glowing pulse, and distinct error states
**Started**: 2026-02-04
**Completed**: (in progress)

## Objectives
- Add ConnectionStatusAnimationState interface to ConnectionStatus.tsx
- Implement glowing green pulse animation for connected state
- Implement animated ring effect for connecting/reconnecting states
- Implement distinct warning visual for disconnected state with reconnect option
- Integrate useReducedMotion hook for accessibility compliance

## Current Component State
The existing ConnectionStatus component (client/src/components/ConnectionStatus.tsx) displays:
- Simple colored dot indicator (green/yellow/red)
- Optional status text label
- Static appearance with no animation

## Target Enhancement
Transform to expressive visual feedback system:
- **Connected**: Glowing green pulse animation (gentle, subtle)
- **Connecting/Reconnecting**: Animated ring effect indicating activity
- **Disconnected**: Distinct warning visual with option to reconnect

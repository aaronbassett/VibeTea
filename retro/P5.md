# Phase 5 Retrospective: User Story 3 - Run Monitor in GitHub Actions Workflow

**Feature**: Monitor GitHub Actions Deployment
**Phase**: 5 - User Story 3 (Priority: P2)
**Started**: 2026-02-04
**Completed**: 2026-02-04

## Objective
Demonstrate monitor deployment pattern in GitHub Actions workflows.

## Tasks

### Documentation
- [x] T071 Add "GitHub Actions Setup" section to README.md (FR-015, FR-016, FR-017, FR-018)
- [x] T072 Commit: add GitHub Actions documentation to README

### Example Workflow
- [x] T073 Create example CI workflow in .github/workflows/ci-with-monitor.yml
- [x] T074 Commit: add example CI workflow with monitor

## Learnings

### What Worked Well
- **Clear FR requirements**: FR-015 through FR-018 precisely defined what documentation was needed
- **Example-driven documentation**: Including a complete, commented workflow example makes adoption easier
- **Non-blocking pattern**: The example workflow demonstrates proper non-blocking monitor integration

### Challenges Encountered
- **Binary download URL**: The example workflow assumes release binaries are published with specific naming convention. Users may need to adjust based on actual release structure.

### Critical Learnings for CLAUDE.md
- No new critical learnings for CLAUDE.md from this phase
- Phase 5 was documentation-focused with no new code patterns

## Notes
- README now includes comprehensive GitHub Actions Setup section with:
  - Step-by-step setup instructions
  - Key export instructions
  - Required secrets documentation
  - Example workflow snippet
  - Troubleshooting guide
- Example workflow uses `workflow_dispatch` trigger by default for safe testing
- VIBETEA_SOURCE_ID format: `github-<owner>/<repo>-<run_id>` provides traceability

# Phase 10 Retrospective: User Story 8 - Display VibeTea Logo

## What Worked Well

- **Three-tier logo degradation**: Full (60+ cols), Compact (30+ cols), Text (<30 cols) provides smooth adaptation
- **logo_height() helper function**: Clean API for layout calculation without exposing internal constants
- **Dual symbol support**: Unicode and ASCII variants work seamlessly with existing Symbols abstraction
- **Widget composability**: LogoWidget integrates naturally into HeaderWidget via Layout splits

## What Didn't Work

- **ASCII art design iteration**: Creating visually appealing box-drawing character logos required several attempts
- **Height calculation complexity**: Needed to coordinate logo height with header borders (+2 for top/bottom)

## Workarounds & Solutions

- **Layout split for logo + status**: Used `Constraint::Fill(1)` for logo and `Constraint::Length()` for status to give logo maximum space while ensuring status always visible
- **Removed block title**: Logo now provides branding, eliminating redundant "VibeTea Monitor" title from header block

## Packages & Dependencies

- No new dependencies - all functionality uses existing ratatui primitives
- Widget pattern continues to work well without requiring additional crates

## Patterns & Code

- **LogoVariant enum**: Clean pattern for selecting display mode based on width
- **Height constants**: `FULL_LOGO_HEIGHT`, `COMPACT_LOGO_HEIGHT`, `TEXT_LOGO_HEIGHT` exported for layout planning
- **Unicode box-drawing**: `╭─╮`, `│`, `╰─╯` for decorative borders
- **Dynamic header height**: `header_height(width)` returns appropriate height based on logo variant

## For Next Time

- Consider animated logo for startup sequence (future enhancement)
- ASCII art could be loaded from external file for easier customization
- Test logo rendering in tmux/screen with various terminal sizes

# Specification Quality Checklist: Monitor GitHub Actions Deployment

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2026-02-03
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

All checklist items pass. The specification is ready for `/sdd:clarify` or `/sdd:plan`.

### Review Summary

The spec was enhanced based on Rust-specific review to include:
- Security requirements (memory zeroing, secret logging prevention)
- CLI behavior requirements (exit codes, signal handling, stdout/stderr discipline)
- Testing requirements (round-trip integration tests)
- Clarified ambiguous requirements (key source precedence logging, export output format)
